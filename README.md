# Smart Lender-Applicant Credibility Prediction For Loan Approval

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project on **SmartLender-Applicant Credibility Prediction For Loan Approval**. In this project, we explore the dynamic relationship between the banking industry and DataScience.

## Project Objective
Our primary goal is to create a prediction model that evaluates loan applicants based on factors such as credit score, income, ongoing EMI's, occupation, age, and repayment history. This model benefits both applicants and banks by reducing the risk of defaulters.
