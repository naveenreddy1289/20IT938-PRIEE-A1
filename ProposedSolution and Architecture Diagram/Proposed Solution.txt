Project name - Smart lender –applicant credibility for loan prediction


1.Problem Statement (Problem to be solved)

The credit system governed by the banks is one of the most important
factors which affect our country’s economy and financial condition. Also,
credit risk is one of the main functions of the banking community. The
prediction of credit defaulters is one of the difficult tasks for any bank. This
problem occurs when the banks need to provide loans to the customers
who are in need of the money. But by forecasting the loan defaulters, the
banks definitely may reduce their loss by reducing their non-profit assets.

2.Idea / Solution Description

This solution uses Machine Learning techniques which can be used to
perform such classifications of the credit defaulters as they are very crucial
and useful in the prediction of these types of data. Classification algorithms
such as Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, Xgboost and SVM will be used.
The data is trained and tested with these algorithms and finally, the best
model is selected and saved in pkl format.

3.Novelty /Uniqueness

The solution tries to use the best model from the mentioned five models and
classify the applicants with least error.

4.Social Impact /Customer Satisfaction

This application will help the bank employees to classify the credit
defaulters accurately with minimum error. So, the non - profit losses of the
banks have been reduced. Thus, they may recover the approved loans with
minimum losses.

5.Scalability of the Solution

The front end of the application is modular. Python Web Framework is used
to do so.A simple Streamlit web appliction.
